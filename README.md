# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
The What's for Dinner? Application is for those days that you just can't think of what you want to make for dinner, all you have to do is pick a dish (side, main, and dessert) and click the "let's cook" button and the app will randomly generate corresponding dishes. This is a great resource to help you decide what to cook!

### Learning Goals:
[//]:  
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:

Some major wins for me during this project, include making an app all by myself! I was able to productively struggle through the assignment and was able to utilize all of the tools that we have learned to problem solve through this exercise!  I spefically am proud that I was able to re write my JS file from my initial strategy of using one function using .innerHTML to control the response box, to refiguring the JS file using innerText so i could free up functionality of the "clear" button and ultimately finish the all three iterations!
